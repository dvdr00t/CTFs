# Inspect HTML

1. [Description](#description)
2. [Script](#script)

#### Description
In this case, we are presented a simple `HTML` page. The first routine is to look for the source files. By accessing the **developer tools** of the Web Browser in use, it is possible to inspect the Web Page Source, i.e. the `HTML` file which is first loaded. In particular, from this file we can already see the flag:
```HTML
<!--picoCTF{1n5p3t0r_0f_h7ml_1fd8425b}-->
```

#### Script
The script takes advantages of the `curl` tool, which retrieves the specific files (i.e. the source page): 
```sh
http://saturn.picoctf.net:50920/
```
and the `grep` tool, which retrieves the specific line of the file we need.
