#### Description
As the website of the challenge reports: 

"*Many programming languages and other computer files have a directive, often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These included files are called copybooks or header files. They are often used to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code and/or forward declarations while promoting encapsulation and the reuse of code.*"

In this case, we are presented a simple `HTML` page containing a `Say hello` button which prompts an alert saying: 
```
This code is in a separate file!
```

In other words, it suggests to look for the other files that are loaded when the web page is loaded. By accessing the **developer tools** of the Web Browser in use, it is possible to inspect the Web Page Source, i.e. the `HTML` file which is first loaded. In particular, from this file we can see two rows which are of our interests:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

and

```HTML
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

These two files are loaded when the `HTML` page is loaded. We can access those files (they are public on this website) by clicking on them. We are redirected to the actual file content.

```HTML
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```

and 

```js


function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}

//  f7w_2of2_df589022}
```

The flag is easily readable now. 

#### Script
The script takes advantages of the `curl` tool, which retrieves the specific files: 
```sh
http://saturn.picoctf.net:54634/style.css
```
and
```sh
http://saturn.picoctf.net:54634/script.js
```

and the `grep` tool, which retrieves the specific line of the file we need.
